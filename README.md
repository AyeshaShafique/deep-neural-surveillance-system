Deep Neural based surveillance system built on flask, OpenCV and Python

This repo is the extended version of this blog:

Here you can find that how you can make your own live streaming Deep Neural based surveillance system with motion tracking, face capturing, real time GPS cordinates and email notification when the face captured.

This is really the high level work im sharing.
